__Notes from 3/14/2025__
# Remove class borderimg at bottom of story.tw unless we get it working as desired in homepage.tw.
# Continue researching how to properly pass styling info as string parameter to {{{<<notify>>}}} macro
# Decide on a stats system for our 'protagonist knight' (i.e., the user); prob can't simulate real combat
# Removed toggle for gamification: users have to play along: tough noogies!
